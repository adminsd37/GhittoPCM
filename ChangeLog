New dependencies: Twisted (http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/) & Zope Interface (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/zope.interface/3.6.7#downloads)
	*MUST install these dependencies before runtime*
Added ability to run as a service (use "-s" or "--service" at the command line, and make sure your GhittoPCM.ini file is complete)
Added ability to run with minimal GhittoPCM.ini (for on-demand mode).  Username, password, and target device can be entered at runtime.  Target directory will be auto-created.
Added pretty web-interface to explore all backed-up devices and revisions.  Ability to compare current file to all past configs.  Use "-w" or "--web" at the command line to launch.

Added ability to work without config file (GhittoPCM.ini) - enter username, password & 1 device to check on the fly

Added line to Git init to work with CRLF oddities (Git was not showing differences, was showing entire deletion and insertion)
